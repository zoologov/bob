# /coordinator — Multi-agent Work Coordinator

> **When to invoke:** during parallel work with multiple agents
> **Focus:** task distribution, synchronization, quality control

---

## Coordinator Activation Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY work, the coordinator MUST:**

1. Complete `/task-init` flow (PRD → RFC → CONTEXT+PLAN → approvals)
2. Output activation status to user:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ COORDINATOR ACTIVATED: {ISSUE-KEY}                      │
│                                                         │
│ Role: Coordinator                                       │
│ Protocol: /coordinator                                  │
│ Task-init: [completed / in progress — current step]     │
│ Beads: [count] (dev: N, test: N, review: N, docs: N)    │
│ Agents: /dev, /test, /review, /tech-writer              │
│ Waves: [count]                                          │
│                                                         │
│ Context sources: strategy specs + sub-agent summaries   │
│ Raw code reading: PROHIBITED (delegated to sub-agents)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Coordinator Context Boundary (MANDATORY)

The coordinator MUST NOT load source code, test files, or DB schemas
into its own context. Technical exploration is ALWAYS delegated to
sub-agents (Explore/dev) running in background.

**Coordinator reads ONLY:**
- CLAUDE.md, skill files (task-init, coordinator, templates)
- STRATEGY-2.md (task tables and high-level specs, not full code examples)
- Feature docs: PRD, RFC, CONTEXT, PLAN, ACTIVE
- beads CLI output (`bd list`, `bd show`, `bd ready`)
- Sub-agent summaries (2-3 lines)
- `beadloom prime` output (compact project context)

**Coordinator NEVER reads:**
- `src/**/*.py` (source code)
- `tests/**/*.py` (test files)
- `.beadloom/_graph/*.yml` (use `beadloom` CLI instead)
- Full sub-agent output (only tail last lines if needed)

**When RFC needs technical context:** delegate to an Explore sub-agent
in background, receive a 20-30 line summary. Never load raw code.

---

## Principles of multi-agent work

1. **One bead = one agent** at any given time
2. **Synchronization through files**, not through chat
3. **CONTEXT.md is the source of truth**
4. **Only independent beads run in parallel** (no shared dependencies)

---

## Agent roles

| Role | Skill | Tasks |
|------|-------|-------|
| Developer | `/dev` | Implementing beads, TDD |
| Reviewer | `/review` | Code review, quality |
| Tester | `/test` | Tests, coverage |
| Coordinator | `/coordinator` | Distribution, synchronization |

---

## Task distribution protocol

```bash
# 1. View available beads
bd ready

# 2. Check the DAG
bd graph --all

# 3. Select independent beads for parallel work
# Example: BEAD-02 and BEAD-04 do not depend on each other

# 4. Assign to agents
bd update <bead-id-1> --assignee "agent-1" --status in_progress
bd update <bead-id-2> --assignee "agent-2" --status in_progress
```

---

## Mandatory bead structure

Every feature/epic MUST have this hierarchy:

```
<parent-id> [feature/epic] — parent bead
├── <parent-id>.N [task/dev]         — dev beads (one per logical unit, /dev agent)
├── <parent-id>.N [task/test]        — test bead (/test agent)
├── <parent-id>.N [task/review]      — review bead (/review agent)
└── <parent-id>.N [task/tech-writer] — doc update bead (/tech-writer agent)
```

**Rules:**
- Dev beads are created ONLY after PLAN is Approved (Step 3.6), NOT before
- Test bead depends on ALL dev beads
- Review bead depends on test bead
- Tech-writer bead depends on review bead
- Parent feature is set to `in_progress` before Wave 1 starts

---

## Wave-based execution

Waves MUST include all three agent roles:

```
Dev waves: Independent dev beads (parallel)
├── Agent-1: BEAD-01 (P0, /dev)
└── Agent-2: BEAD-04 (P0, independent, /dev)

Dev waves: After Wave 1 completion
├── Agent-1: BEAD-02 (/dev)
├── Agent-2: BEAD-03 (/dev)
└── Agent-3: BEAD-06 (/dev)

Test wave: After all dev beads complete
└── Agent: BEAD-test (/test)

Review wave: After test wave
└── Agent: BEAD-review (/review)
    ├── Review = OK → proceed to tech-writer
    └── Review = ISSUES → coordinator restarts dev→test→review cycle

Tech-writer wave: ONLY after review = OK
└── Agent: BEAD-docs (/tech-writer)
```

---

## Review feedback loop

When the `/review` agent completes, it returns one of two outcomes:

```
Review = OK     → coordinator proceeds to tech-writer wave
Review = ISSUES → coordinator handles fixes (see below)
```

**When review returns ISSUES:**

1. Coordinator reads review comments via `bd comments <review-bead-id>`
2. Coordinator creates new fix beads under the same parent:
   ```bash
   bd create --type task --title "[ISSUE-KEY] Fix: <review finding>" --parent <parent-id>
   bd dep add <new-fix-bead> <review-bead>
   ```
3. Coordinator launches a new dev→test→review cycle for fix beads only
4. Cycle repeats until review = OK
5. Only then: tech-writer wave starts

**IMPORTANT:** The tech-writer bead MUST NOT start until review is fully clean.
The coordinator is responsible for gating this transition.

---

## Context Overflow Protection

> **CRITICAL:** Parallel agents overflow the parent context window.
> Without protection, `/compact` fails and the session is lost.

### Rule 1: Background agents (MANDATORY for waves)

ALWAYS launch parallel agents with `run_in_background: true`:

```python
Task(
    prompt="...",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    run_in_background=True,    # MANDATORY — results go to file, not context
)
```

- Agent results go to an `output_file`, NOT into parent context
- Parent checks progress via `bd list` + `bd comments <id>`
- Parent reads `output_file` only if needed (tail last 20 lines)

### Rule 2: Agent return contract

Every agent prompt MUST include this instruction:

```
RETURN CONTRACT: When done, return ONLY a 2-3 line summary:
"BEAD-XX done. N tests added. Files: list."
Write ALL details to bead comments via `bd comments add`.
Do NOT return file contents, diffs, or verbose test output.
```

### Rule 3: Compaction between waves

After each wave completes:

```bash
# 1. Verify all beads in wave are closed
bd list --status in_progress

# 2. Read ACTIVE.md (will survive compaction)
# Update ACTIVE.md with wave results

# 3. /compact — compress parent context

# 4. After compaction: read ACTIVE.md to restore state
# Then launch next wave
```

### Rule 4: One bead = one agent

Do NOT batch multiple beads into one agent (e.g., "BEAD-02 + BEAD-08").
Each bead gets its own agent. This keeps individual agent contexts smaller
and makes failures isolated.

---

## Launching sub-agents

**ALWAYS use `run_in_background: true` for parallel agents.**

```
Coordinator launches sub-agents in parallel (background):

Agent-1 (developer, background):
- Bead: BEAD-XX
- Skill: /dev
- Context: CONTEXT.md, ACTIVE.md
- Return: 2-3 line summary only

Agent-2 (developer, background):
- Bead: BEAD-YY
- Skill: /dev
- Context: CONTEXT.md, ACTIVE.md
- Return: 2-3 line summary only
```

---

## Requirements for sub-agent upon completion

**MANDATORY for each sub-agent:**

```bash
# 1. All tests pass
uv run pytest

# 2. Beadloom validation
beadloom reindex
beadloom sync-check
beadloom lint --strict

# 3. Add checkpoint with results (THIS is where details go)
bd comments add <bead-id> "$(cat <<'EOF'
COMPLETED:
- What was done: [list]
- Decisions: [if any]
- Tests: [result]
- Files: [changed files]
- TODO: [if any]
EOF
)"

# 4. Close the bead
bd close <bead-id>

# 5. Return ONLY a 2-3 line summary (NOT full details)
```

---

## Coordinator checklist before wave commit

```
BEFORE WAVE COMMIT:

□ All sub-agents have completed their beads
□ bd comments shows checkpoints for ALL beads in the wave
□ CONTEXT.md is up to date:
  - Phase matches reality
  - "Related files" includes new modules
  - "Last updated" is filled in
□ ACTIVE.md reflects completed work
□ All tests pass (uv run pytest)
□ beadloom reindex — index is fresh
□ beadloom sync-check — no stale docs
□ beadloom lint --strict — no architecture violations
□ beadloom doctor — graph integrity ok
□ All beads are closed (bd close)
```

---

## File synchronization

| File | Who updates | When |
|------|-------------|------|
| CONTEXT.md | Coordinator | After wave, architectural decisions |
| ACTIVE.md | Sub-agent | During work |
| beads (comments) | Sub-agent | Checkpoints, completion |
| PLAN.md | Coordinator | When DAG changes |

---

## Conflict resolution

If a discrepancy is found:

1. **Stop all sub-agents**
2. Report the discrepancy to the user
3. Wait for a decision
4. Update files according to the decision
5. Restart sub-agents

---

## Changing the DAG mid-process

```bash
# 1. Stop work
# 2. Add dependency
bd dep add <bead-id> <depends-on-id>

# 3. Check the graph
bd graph --all

# 4. Notify the user
```

## Beadloom UX Feedback (Dogfooding)

> **MANDATORY:** We use Beadloom as our project management tool. Collect UX feedback to improve it.

**File:** `.claude/dev-docs/Beadloom-UX-Issues.md`

**When to log:**
- Any Beadloom command that fails unexpectedly or gives confusing output
- Friction points in the workflow (e.g., too many steps, unclear error messages)
- Missing features that would help the current task
- Surprising behavior or inconsistencies

**Who logs:**
- **Coordinator** — logs issues encountered during orchestration (prime, graph, lint, sync-check)
- **Sub-agents** — report Beadloom issues in bead comments; coordinator transfers to UX file

**Format:** Follow the template in `Beadloom-UX-Issues.md`
