## Work start protocol

```bash
# 1. Get project context
beadloom prime                    # compact architecture + health overview

# 2. Check available tasks
bd ready

# 3. Claim a task
bd update <bead-id> --status in_progress --claim

# 4. Understand the area you'll touch
beadloom ctx <ref-id>             # architecture context: code, docs, constraints
beadloom why <ref-id>             # impact: what depends on this?

# 5. Read epic context (if applicable)
# - .claude/development/docs/features/{ISSUE-KEY}/CONTEXT.md
# - .claude/development/docs/features/{ISSUE-KEY}/ACTIVE.md
```

**Confirm to the user:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Context loaded: {ISSUE-KEY}             │
│ Bead: <bead-id> — [name]               │
│ Goal: [from CONTEXT]                    │
│ Plan: [from ACTIVE or create one]       │
│ Ready to proceed?                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## TDD Workflow (MANDATORY)

```
RED      → Write a test → make sure it fails
GREEN    → Write minimal code → test passes
REFACTOR → Improve the code → tests stay green
REPEAT   → Next test case
```

**Rules:**
1. DO NOT write production code without a failing test
2. Write only enough test to make it fail
3. Write only enough code to make the test pass
4. Refactor only when tests are green

## Beadloom Architecture

### Discover project structure (always use these, never hardcode paths)

```bash
beadloom prime                   # compact project context for quick orientation
beadloom graph                   # Mermaid diagram: domains, features, services, edges
beadloom ctx <domain>            # full context for a domain: source files, symbols, docs
beadloom ctx <feature>           # full context for a feature
beadloom status                  # overview: node counts, doc coverage, health trends
beadloom why <ref-id>            # impact analysis: what depends on / is depended by
beadloom search "<query>"        # FTS5 search across nodes, docs, and code
```

### Architecture Discovery (never hardcode paths)

```bash
beadloom graph                   # see actual layers, domains, dependencies
beadloom ctx <domain>            # full context: source, docs, constraints for a domain
beadloom why <ref-id>            # impact: what depends on this component?
```

### DDD + Clean Architecture Rules

Dependencies point **inward**: outer layers depend on inner, never reverse.

```
API / Entry points  →  Application / Use cases  →  Domain  →  Infrastructure
```

**General rules:**
- Each top-level package is a **Bounded Context** (discover via `beadloom graph`)
- Domains are **isolated** from each other (no cross-domain imports)
- Infrastructure is **domain-agnostic** (no business logic)
- Entry points (API, CLI) depend on domains, never reverse

**Where to place new code:**

1. Business logic → domain package (discover domains via `beadloom prime`)
2. API endpoints, CLI commands → entry point layer
3. DB access, file I/O, config → infrastructure layer
4. Unsure? Run `beadloom why <ref-id>` and `beadloom ctx <domain>` to find the right home

**Verification:** `beadloom lint --strict` enforces these boundaries. Fix violations before committing.

### Validation during development

```bash
beadloom reindex                 # after code/graph changes
beadloom sync-check              # before commit: are docs fresh?
beadloom lint --strict           # before commit: architecture boundaries ok?
beadloom doctor                  # graph integrity
```

## Code Patterns (Python)

### Dataclasses for models

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Goal:
    id: str
    title: str
    priority: int
    status: str  # pending | active | completed | failed
    parent_id: str | None = None
    metadata: dict[str, str] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### Exceptions

```python
# Project-level base exception; discover actual hierarchy via beadloom ctx
class BobError(Exception):
    """Base project exception."""

class GoalNotFoundError(BobError):
    def __init__(self, goal_id: str) -> None:
        self.goal_id = goal_id
        super().__init__(f"Goal not found: {goal_id}")
```

### Working with paths

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Always pathlib, never os.path
config_dir = project_root / "config"
for yaml_file in config_dir.glob("*.yaml"):
    ...
```

### Working with SQLite

```python
import sqlite3

# Always parameterized queries
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM nodes WHERE ref_id = ?",
    (ref_id,),
)

# Never f-strings in SQL
# cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM nodes WHERE ref_id = '{ref_id}'")  # FORBIDDEN
```

### YAML

```python
import yaml

# Always safe_load
with open(path) as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Never yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
```

### Clean Code Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **SRP** | One module/function = one responsibility |
| **DRY** | Do not duplicate logic |
| **KISS** | A simple solution is better than a complex one |
| **YAGNI** | Do not write code "for the future" |

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Style | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Files/modules | snake_case | `context_builder.py` |
| Classes | PascalCase | `ContextBuilder` |
| Functions/methods | snake_case | `get_context_bundle` |
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE` |
| Private | `_prefix` | `_build_subgraph` |

## During work

### After each significant action:

1. **Update ACTIVE.md:**
   ```markdown
   - [x] Step N: description (completed HH:MM)
   ```

2. **Add checkpoint in beads (every 30 min or 5 steps):**
   ```bash
   bd comments add <bead-id> "CHECKPOINT: [what was done]"
   ```

3. **For architectural decisions:**
   - Update CONTEXT.md (decisions table)
   - Update RFC.md

---

## Completing a bead

```bash
# 1. Make sure tests pass
uv run pytest

# 2. Linter and types
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run mypy src/

# 3. Beadloom validation
beadloom reindex
beadloom sync-check
beadloom lint --strict

# 4. If public API changed, log it for /review and /tech-writer
# bd comments add <bead-id> "API CHANGE: <what changed>. Docs to check: <list>"
# Example: "API CHANGE: NodeMatcher gained exclude field. Docs to check: docs/domains/graph/README.md, rule-engine/SPEC.md"

# 5. Add final checkpoint
bd comments add <bead-id> "$(cat <<'EOF'
COMPLETED:
- What was done: [list]
- Decisions: [if any]
- Tests: [result]
- API changes: [if any — new fields, parameters, classes, YAML schema]
- TODO: [if any]
EOF
)"

# 5. Close the bead
bd close <bead-id>

# 6. Check what got unblocked
bd ready
```

## Code restrictions

| Forbidden | Alternative |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Any` without reason | Explicit types, `object`, generics |
| `# type: ignore` without comment | Fix the typing |
| `print()` / `breakpoint()` | `logging` module |
| Magic numbers | Named constants |
| Commented-out code | Delete or TODO |
| Hardcoded secrets | Environment variables |
| Nesting > 3 levels | Early return, extract function |
| Functions > 30 lines | Split into smaller ones |
| Bare `except:` | `except SpecificError:` |
| `import *` | Explicit imports |
| `def f(x=[]):` | `def f(x: list | None = None):` |
| `os.path` | `pathlib.Path` |
| f-strings in SQL | Parameterized queries `?` |
| `yaml.load()` | `yaml.safe_load()` |

---

## Logging

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info("Reindex completed", extra={"nodes": count, "duration_ms": elapsed})
```

**Forbidden to log:** passwords, tokens, API keys, PII

## Developer checklist

### When starting a bead
- [ ] `bd ready` -> selected a task
- [ ] `bd update <id> --status in_progress --claim`
- [ ] Read CONTEXT.md and ACTIVE.md
- [ ] Confirmed understanding to the user

### During work
- [ ] Following TDD: RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
- [ ] Updating ACTIVE.md after each step
- [ ] Checkpoint in beads every 30 min
- [ ] Architectural decisions -> CONTEXT.md

### When completing
- [ ] `uv run pytest` — all tests pass
- [ ] `uv run ruff check` — linter is clean
- [ ] `uv run mypy src/` — typing is ok
- [ ] `beadloom reindex` — index is fresh
- [ ] `beadloom sync-check` — no stale docs
- [ ] `beadloom lint --strict` — no architecture violations
- [ ] **API CHANGE check** — if you changed public APIs (new fields, parameters, classes, YAML schema), log it in bead comments so /review and /tech-writer know which docs to check
- [ ] Final checkpoint in beads
- [ ] `bd close <bead-id>`
- [ ] ACTIVE.md cleared for the next bead
